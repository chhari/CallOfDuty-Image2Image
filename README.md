# CallOfDuty-Image2Image
Call of Duty Image to Image Translation version

We present a conditional generative adversarial network to solve image-to-image translation problems. The generator utilizes the U-Net model - an encoder-decoder network
with skips to shuttle low-level information between
layers. We combine the pixel-wise reconstruction distance
with the adversarial loss as the objective function to train
the framework.We not only qualitatively but also quantitatively
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on synthesizing
photos from labels, maps and reconstructing objects
from edge maps
